# rotf.tk-tyni.cf
A basic python/js url shortener made to be hosted on repl.it.


# Why I am being redirected to this?
I have taken down the service as of 1/24/23. Misuse and overall issues with me not being able to remove malicous keys have been extremely annoying hence why I have decided to completely take down both.

## Any alternatives?
https://tinyurl.com is one of my favorites.




# If you were an active user of the service, I thank you in your time of using it.



# What's missing?
## Currently files to tyni.cf (nothing changes really just some code for the website) which will not be uploaded and contain nothing of use.
## Terms of service & more, though I don't know if i'll be uploading those.
